# Portfolio 2.0 üíº
Welcome to Portfolio 2.0, a sleek, powerful and a completelely revamped Portfolio website built with NextJS and ChakraUI and deployed on Vercel. Without a doubt, a portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. It‚Äôs like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. However, Why why did i choose Next.js? Because it is a React framework with Server-Side Rendering, which is good for SEO (Good for us if we get found on Google, right?). And why did I decide to go with Chakra UI ? It's easy to use first of all, it has responsive design capabilities, customizable styling, accessibility features, excellent developer experience, and an active community support. Also, Next.js helps us build a full back-end & blazing-fast websites along with benefits such as Image optimization.
