        ["This project focuses on control of brightness of LED Lamp via Hand Gestures through Computer Vision technology thereby rejecting the age old method of switch based control and also demonstrates the potential of Hand Gesture Recognition Technology and its applications in real world scenarios.",
        "The Hand-Gesture Recognition Module has been implemented using Python programming language. It contains a handDetector Class that accepts RGB Images and searches for hands in the same. Also it has the added functionality of figuring out how many fingers are up and distance between any two fingers. OpenCV-Python and Mediapipe are two of the major Python libraries used in the project.",
        "The Arduino Nano (V3) is responsible for maintaining a Serial Communication between the Python program and the electrical appliance ( LEDs in this case )."
